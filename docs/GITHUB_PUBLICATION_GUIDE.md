## 🏗️ Creating GitHub Repository

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. **Go to GitHub**
   - Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
   - Select "New repository"

2. **Repository Settings**
   ```
   Repository name: ally_care_demo
   Description: A comprehensive healthcare platform connecting patients with healthcare providers - Flutter Demo
   Visibility: Public (recommended for demo projects)
   
   ✅ Add a README file: NO (we already have one)
   ✅ Add .gitignore: NO (we already have one)
   ✅ Choose a license: NO (we already have one)
   ```

3. **Create Repository**
   - Click "Create repository"
   - Copy the repository URL (you'll need it later)

### Step 2: Repository Description and Topics

After creating the repository, add a detailed description and topics:

**Description:**
```
🏥 AllyCare - A comprehensive Flutter healthcare platform demo featuring appointment scheduling, health assessments, wellness tracking, and secure patient-provider communication. Built with Firebase, Riverpod, and Material Design 3.
```

**Topics (add these tags):**
```
flutter, dart, healthcare, firebase, riverpod, material-design, mobile-app, 
healthcare-platform, appointment-booking, health-assessment, wellness-tracking,
telemedicine, flutter-demo, open-source, mit-license
```

---

## 🔧 Initial Setup

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

If you haven't already initialized git in your project:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/ally_care_demo

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ally_care_demo.git
```

### Step 2: Verify .gitignore

Ensure your `.gitignore` file properly excludes sensitive files:

```bash
# Check if sensitive files are ignored
git check-ignore .env
git check-ignore android/app/google-services.json
git check-ignore ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist

# These commands should return the file paths if they're properly ignored
```

### Step 3: Create Your Environment File

```bash
# Copy the template to create your local environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your actual Firebase configuration
# (This file will NOT be committed to GitHub)
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

---

## 📤 First Commit and Push

### Step 1: Stage Files

```bash
# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Check what will be committed (verify no sensitive files)
git status

# If you see any sensitive files listed, add them to .gitignore immediately
```

### Step 2: Verify No Sensitive Data

**Critical Check:** Ensure no sensitive information will be committed:

```bash
# Search for potential API keys or secrets
grep -r "AIzaSy" . --exclude-dir=.git --exclude="*.md" --exclude=".env*"
grep -r "firebase" . --exclude-dir=.git --exclude="*.md" --exclude=".env*" | grep -i "key\|secret\|token"

# If any results show actual API keys, remove them before committing
```

### Step 3: Create Initial Commit

```bash
# Create your first commit
git commit -m "feat: initial commit - AllyCare healthcare platform demo

- Add comprehensive Flutter healthcare platform
- Implement secure Firebase configuration with environment variables
- Include appointment scheduling and health assessment features
- Add Material Design 3 UI with dark/light theme support
- Set up Riverpod state management
- Include comprehensive documentation and setup guides
- Add MIT license for open source distribution"
```

### Step 4: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## ⚙️ Repository Configuration

### Step 1: Configure Repository Settings

1. **Go to Repository Settings**
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Settings" tab

2. **General Settings**
   - **Features**: Enable Issues, Wiki, Discussions
   - **Pull Requests**: Enable "Allow merge commits" and "Allow squash merging"
   - **Archives**: Enable "Include Git LFS objects in archives"

3. **Security Settings**
   - **Security & Analysis**: Enable all security features
   - **Secrets and Variables**: We'll configure this next

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Actions (Optional)

Create a basic CI/CD workflow:

```bash
# Create GitHub Actions directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Setup Flutter
      uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
      with:
        flutter-version: '3.8.1'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: flutter pub get
      
    - name: Verify formatting
      run: flutter format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .
      
    - name: Analyze project source
      run: flutter analyze
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: flutter test --coverage
      
    - name: Upload coverage reports
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        file: coverage/lcov.info
```

### Step 3: Configure Branch Protection

1. **Go to Settings > Branches**
2. **Add Rule for `main` branch:**
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Include administrators in restrictions

   - No API keys in any files

2. **Template Files Present:**
   - `android/app/google-services.json.template`

cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ally_care_demo.git
cd ally_care_demo

# Follow your own setup instructions
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with test values
flutter pub get

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues During Publication

#### 1. Sensitive Files Accidentally Committed

**If you accidentally commit sensitive files:**

```bash
# Remove file from git but keep locally
git rm --cached .env
git rm --cached android/app/google-services.json

# Add to .gitignore if not already there
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
echo "android/app/google-services.json" >> .gitignore

# Commit the removal
git commit -m "fix: remove sensitive configuration files"
git push origin main

# For complete history cleanup (use with caution):
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env' \
--prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

#### 2. Large File Issues

**If you have large files causing push issues:**

```bash
# Check file sizes
find . -type f -size +50M

# Use Git LFS for large files
git lfs track "*.apk"
git lfs track "*.ipa"
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "feat: add Git LFS tracking for large files"
```

#### 3. Firebase Configuration Issues

**If users report Firebase setup problems:**

1. **Update documentation** with more detailed steps
2. **Create video tutorial** for complex setup
3. **Add troubleshooting section** to ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md
4. **Provide example configurations** (without real keys)

#### 4. Build Failures After Clone

**Common solutions:**

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Clear pub cache if needed
flutter pub cache repair

# Regenerate code
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
